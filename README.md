# LAPR3-1920

## What can I find here?

The code for the curricular unit of LAPR3 of the first semester of 2019/2020. This code was developed on Java and uses persistence to save and fetch data from an SQL database provided by the college. 

The main goal of the project was the management of eletric scooters that were owned by a company that provides rental for them, as well as the management of the parks and the charging of the e-scooters.

Multiple test scenarios have been developed, as well as a Java Code Coverage above 95% (report created using Jacoco's tool in the command line).
